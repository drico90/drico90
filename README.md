 Hi! 👋, I'm Adriano! A technology enthusiast and Python student from Brazil.

🌱 I'm currently studying SQL, NoSQL Python and data engineering concepts at Digital Innovation One.

🔭 I'm looking for my first opportunity as a Jr developer. My dream is to work on developing friendly and intuitive solutions that facilitate the use of technology.

👨‍💻More about me:

I currently work as a PMO at Cognizant and I will share a little about my routine, responsibilities and role. As a Junior PMO, I am involved in a variety of crucial tasks to ensure the success of the projects I am involved with. This includes assisting in the creation and maintenance of project plans, monitoring the progress of activities, preparing status reports and ensuring that everyone involved is aligned with established objectives and deadlines. Additionally, I am responsible for keeping project documentation up to date, organizing meetings and facilitating communication between team members. This experience, as well as the previous ones, brought me a lot of knowledge and I know they will help me in my role as a developer.
